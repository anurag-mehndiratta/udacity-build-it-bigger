# Make Your App Material

This is the Project 5 of Udacity Android Nanodegree.

This project involves updating the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications and translates a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

This project gives opportunity to 
- improve an appâ€™s design
- a vital skill for building apps users will love. 

It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.
